HashTable:
    HashTable is previous version of HashMap. Hashtable is thread safe. it uses synchronization to achieve
    thread safety and because of this it is slow as compared to hashMap.
why we should not use Hashtable.
    As a Tester its very rare that we will be writing multithreaded code and if you don't write multithreaded
    code but still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benefit.
Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
    Hashtable is thread safe while hashMap is not.
Maps:
    How can we iterate through a map

Important concepts for your coding tests:
if else conditions
loops
arrays
String class methods
ArrayList
Maps

important concepts for verbal interviews:
OOPs
for Frameworks:
1) how Classes work for example how to create a class how to declare instance variables how to use them inside
methods
2) Go through all the concepts of methods
3) types of variables like instance static(you will be using heavily)
5) inheritance
6) ArrayList and maps
FileHandling in java:
    Reading writing and manipulating files.

Why we should learn about file handling?
  1) We don't store sensitive data inside the code it might get exposed when we push the code to GitHub.
  2) Hardcoding the data or credentials in code is a very bad practice because for any reason if you have
  to change the credentials or that data you will have to change it everywhere which will take a lot of time
  3) when we have to perform data driven testing we use a lot of data to perform this type of testing
  it is not feasible to put all of that data in code.
Steps to Read from any file in java:
    1) First we need the location(path)
    2) Use a class to navigate to that location (for example FileInputStream)
    3) We need a class that can help us read/write data to that special type of file for example
    for .properties file we use Properties and for excel we use XSSFWorkbook
