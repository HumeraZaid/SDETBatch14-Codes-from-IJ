Maps in Java:
    Maps are datastructures that allow us to store key value pairs.
Why we should use Maps?
    Whenever we have to store key value pairs instead of using arrays or 2D arrays or ArrayLists we should use
    Maps because they provide very good performance and have built-in methods to process the data.
What is the syntax of Maps?
    Map<DataTypeOfKey,DataTypeOfValue> anyName=new MapClass<>();
    for example if we have to store fruit and their prices we will do something like this
    HashMap<String,Double> fruit=new HashMap<>();
Types Of Maps:
    1) HashMap 2) LinkedHashMap 3) TreeMap
HashMap:
    This is the most widely used type of map reason, it is fastest and occupies less memory.
    we should always use Hashmap if there are no requirements for insertion order or sorting.
LinkedHashMap:
    LinkedHashMap keeps the insertion order, but it takes a little more memory than HashMap and is a little slower.
TreeMap:
    TreeMap sorts the data in natural order but insertion is very slow. it takes more memory to keep the data in sorted
    order.
FileHandling:
    Reading writing data to files with the help of java is called file handling.
Steps to read data from any files on any computer:
    1)location of file on our computer.
    2) we need to go to that location.
    3) we need a software that can read and write data to that file for example we need Microsoft Excel if we
    want to work with xlsx files.
